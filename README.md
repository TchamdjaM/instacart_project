# ML-Project_Retail-Insights

We use Machine Learning to discover product bundles and customer patterns from the Instacart dataset.
We compare Apriori.
We build simple customer segments and a basic revenue/ROI simulator to estimate potential gains or savings.
A one-page Flask web app shows the key results (bundles, segments, and estimated impact).

The data came from kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/instacart-online-grocery-basket-analysis-dataset
